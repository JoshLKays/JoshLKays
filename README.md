- 👋 Hi, I’m @JoshLKays
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to connect databases to web applications, how to properly structure workflow for a coding project, and just want to learn the ropes as I am a GitHub newbie. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning different concepts of Agile and Operating Systems in my SNHU Courserwork, and I am currently doing a self-directed JavaScript course through Educative. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project to understand more about hou the system works and gain as much knowledge as possible.
